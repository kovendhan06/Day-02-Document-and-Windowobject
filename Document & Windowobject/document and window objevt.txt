                            In that following blog we can discussed about  the Differance between DOCUMENT and WINDOW OBJECT Model...
    

                            Document :
                                         A Document object represents the HTML document that is displayes in that window.
                                     The Document object has various properties that refer to other object which allow access to and modification of
                                     document content.
                                       
                                     The way a document content is accessed and modified is called the Document Object Model or DOM.

                                         Javsscript is a language with it's own Syntax and built in types.document is not defined in the Javascript
                                     (also moreformally known as ECMA Script) specification.Document is provided as an object API by the 
                                     Javascript "host" Enviroinment which in a webpage scenario is the user agent(also known as browser).

                            The Document Object:

                                          when an HTML document is loaded into a web browser it becomes a document object.the document objct is the 
                                       root node of the HTML document.The document object is aproperty of the window object.
                          
                            Document Tree:
                                          Each HTML document canactually be refered to as a document tree.we descripe the element in the tree like 
                                       we would descripe a family tree.There are ancestors decendants,parents children and siblings.Itnis important to 
                                       understand the document tree because the selectors use the document tree.


                                                               Window Object
                                         
                                            The window object is supported by all browsers.It represents the browser window.All global Javascript Objects
                                       functions and variables automatically become members of the window object.Global variables are properties of the
                                       window object Global functions are methodw of the Window object.

                           
                            Methods of Window Object:
                                             The important methods of Window object are follows:

                                     method                                             description
                                   
                                     alert()                        Display the alert box containing message with ok buttton.
                                  
                                     confirm()                      Display the confirm dialog box containing message with ok and cancel button.
                                       
                                     Prompt()                       Display the dialogbox to get input from user.

                                     open()                         Open the new window.

                                     close()                        Close the current window.
                                  
                                     setTimeout()                   Perform actions after specified time like calling function evaluvating
                                                                    expressions etc...

                                           
                                                    DIFFERANCE BETWEEN THE DOCUMENT AND WINDOW OBJECT
     
                                      DOCUMENT                                                      WINDOW OBJECT

                          1. It represents any HTML document or Web page that is           It represents a browser window or frame that display the 
                             loaded in the browser.                                        content of thw webpage.

                          
                          2. It is loaded inside the window.                                It is very first object that is loaded in the browser.

                         
                          3. It is object of window property .                              It is object of the browser.               


                          4. All the tags,elements with attributes in HTML or                Global objects,functions and variables of javascript are
                             part of the document.                                           member of the window object.
                     
                          5. The document is part of BOM(browser object)model                The window is part of BOM not DOM.
                             and DOM (document object model).

  
                             syntax:                                                         syntax:                                                                                                      
                                    document.propertyname                                           window.propertyname
                           
                              Example:                                                       Example:
                                    document.title : will return the title                           window.innsheight : will return the height of the                                   
                                    of the document.                                                 content area of the browser.
